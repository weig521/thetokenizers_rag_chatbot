## Campus Assignment

### **WELCOME, STUDENTS!**

Congratulations once again on your acceptance to the University of South Florida!
We understand it can be confusing when your admission is reassigned from the Tampa
campus to the St. Petersburg or Sarasota-Manatee campus. We’re here to help! Here
are answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about campus assignment.

#### What Is Campus Assignment?

Students who meet all of USF’s admission criteria may be accepted to a USF campus
other than the one requested on their application—this is called a campus assignment
update. Campus assignment updates typically occur when students apply after USF’s
priority application deadline and the campus they choose has reached capacity. As
part of campus assignment, the student is admitted to an alternate USF campus that
offers their intended major.

#### Can I Switch Campuses?

Once you complete the Fall semester at the St. Petersburg or Sarasota-Manatee campus,
you will have the opportunity to work with your academic advisor to determine which
campus (Tampa, St. Petersburg or Sarasota-Manatee) is right for you for the Spring
semester and beyond.

#### What Are My Next Steps?

If you accept your offer of admission to the St. Petersburg or Sarasota-Manatee campus,
please continue to complete your checklist items on your onboarding checklist.

[Onboarding Checklist](https://discover.usf.edu/apply/status)

Your next steps may include:

* Submitting your admission deposit.
* Reserving an Orientation date.
* Signing up for housing, and more.

***You do not need to submit any separate documentation to accept your assigned campus
as your home campus.***

### **Campus Assignment FAQs**

#### **Admissions-Related Questions**

[Show **I received an offer of admission to a different campus. Why did I not receive admission
to my first-choice campus?**](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/next-steps/campus-assignment.aspx)

In some majors, there are more applications from admissible candidates than there
are spaces available. Applicants who meet the admission criteria and apply after the
priority deadline may be admitted to a different USF campus that still has spaces
available and offers the declared major.

[Show **If I didn’t get into the campus I want, can I apply for a different semester?**](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/next-steps/campus-assignment.aspx)

Students may request a deferment of up to one year through the Office of Admissions.

[Show **Does each campus have different requirements for admission?**](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/next-steps/campus-assignment.aspx)

Admission requirements for USF are the same across all three campuses. However, students
who apply by the priority application deadline generally have a higher chance of acceptance,
particularly for their preferred campus.

[Show **Am I able to switch to my preferred campus? If so, when?**](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/next-steps/campus-assignment.aspx)

Students have the option to change their home campus after enrollment at their assigned
home campus and a certain waiting period. Students admitted to Summer or Fall may
elect to change their home campus for Spring.

For example, if you are admitted to Summer, you may switch your home campus for Spring
of the following year\*. Students work with their academic advisors located on the
preferred campus to request a change of campus.

*\*Changing your home campus or choosing to take courses on a different campus does
not void your Housing Agreement. See the housing section for more information.*

[Show **Now that I am admitted, am I allowed to change my major? What if my new major is not
offered on the campus to which I am admitted?**](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/next-steps/campus-assignment.aspx)

Students who wish to change their major after admission will need to meet with their
academic advisor. If the new major is not offered at their assigned campus, they can
request a change of both campus and major, space permitting.

[Show **If I am admitted to a different campus and later decide it is not for me, are there
penalties for canceling or not accepting admission at this time?**](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/next-steps/campus-assignment.aspx)

There are no penalties for canceling admission, except the forfeiture of the admission
deposit, if applicable. You can decide not to accept the offer and may choose to apply
before the priority deadline to a future semester.

#### **Campus Experience Questions**

[Show **I want to learn more about each of the USF campuses, specifically about activities
and student life. What are the differences, and where can I learn more?**](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/next-steps/campus-assignment.aspx)

USF has numerous resources to assist students in learning about our campuses and student
life.

[Virtual and On-Campus Tours](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/visit/index.aspx)

Learn more about [student life at each campus](https://www.usf.edu/student-affairs/).

[Show **Can I participate in student organizations, athletics or events at any campus?**](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/next-steps/campus-assignment.aspx)

Yes, you can participate in any USF organization on any campus regardless of your
home campus. Please [contact the individual organization](https://www.usf.edu/student-affairs/leadership-civic-engagement/student-organizations/join-student-org.aspx) for more information on their criteria.

---

#### **Housing Questions**

[Show **Can I live on one campus and take classes at a different one?**](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/next-steps/campus-assignment.aspx)

Yes, you may take classes at any campus regardless which campus you call home. You
will want to consider commute time and parking when you build your schedule.

[Show **I plan to live in USF housing. Will my housing contract transfer or will it be canceled
if I switch to a different campus after the Fall semester? What about my meal plan?**](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/next-steps/campus-assignment.aspx)

Changing your home campus or choosing to take courses on a different campus does not
void your [Housing Agreement](https://www.stpetersburg.usf.edu/student-life/housing/housing-and-dining/student-housing-agreements.aspx).

If you want to live on a different campus and have a Fall/Spring academic year Housing
Agreement, you will need to request a cancellation in your Housing Portal and apply
for housing at the campus you want to move to. Please understand there will likely
be very few openings for Spring semester. If there is not a space available on the
campus you want to live on, it does not void your Housing Agreement. If you are not
able to secure a space on the other campus, your Housing Agreement for your original
campus remains in place.

Meal plans can be used on any campus. Moving from one campus housing location to a
different campus housing location does not void your Meal Plan Agreement. All Fall
meal plan selections will automatically renew as the meal plan selection for the Spring
semester. Failure to review the Spring student tuition bill does not constitute grounds
for refund or cancellation. You may change your meal plan selection for the Spring
semester by filling out the meal plan change form by the end of the meal plan change
period. This change is subject to approval by USF Dining.

[Show **What housing options exist on each campus?**](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/next-steps/campus-assignment.aspx)

The Tampa, St. Petersburg and Sarasota-Manatee campuses offer on-campus housing. Please
visit USF’s Housing and Residential Education website for more information and to
learn about our many options, from apartments to suites, as well as our Residential
Community Programs and Living-Learning Communities:

[Tampa Campus Housing and Residential Education](https://www.usf.edu/housing/housing-options/index.aspx)

[Sarasota-Manatee Campus Housing and Residential Education](https://www.sarasotamanatee.usf.edu/housing/index.aspx)

[St. Petersburg Campus Housing and Residential Education](https://www.stpetersburg.usf.edu/student-life/housing/index.aspx)

#### **Onboarding Questions**

[Show **Can I complete Orientation at a different campus if I plan to attend there in the
Spring?**](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/next-steps/campus-assignment.aspx)

You must complete Orientation for your assigned home campus.

For example, if you’ve been admitted to the St. Petersburg campus, you must complete
the St. Petersburg campus Orientation.

[Show **Are immunization requirements the same across all three campuses?**](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/next-steps/campus-assignment.aspx)

Yes, immunization requirements are the same for all USF campuses. To learn more about
what is required and how to satisfy your requirements, visit the [Student Health Services website](https://www.usf.edu/student-affairs/student-health-services/immunizations/).

[Show **Would I meet with an academic advisor at my preferred campus to schedule my classes
if I plan to change campuses later?**](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/next-steps/campus-assignment.aspx)

Students will meet with an advisor at their assigned campus.

For example, if you are assigned to the St. Petersburg campus, you will meet with
an academic advisor on the St. Petersburg campus. If a student changes to a different
campus, a new advisor at that campus will be assigned.

#### **Financial Questions**

[Show **Do any/all scholarships/grants received apply to the campus I am now assigned to?**](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/next-steps/campus-assignment.aspx)

[Freshmen Admissions Scholarships](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/admissions-scholarships/) are available to qualified admitted students regardless of the campus students attend.
Scholarships are also transferable between campuses if you change campuses at a later
date.

Scholarships are awarded on a funds-available basis. Students must complete their
application by the priority deadline listed on the [Freshmen Admissions Scholarships](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/admissions-scholarships/) to be considered.

[Show **Will tuition/fees stay the same regardless of the campus I attend?**](https://www.usf.edu/admissions/freshmen/next-steps/campus-assignment.aspx)

There are slight differences in tuition and fees at each of the USF campuses. Tuition
and fee information is updated annually and can be found on the USF Controller’s Office
website.
