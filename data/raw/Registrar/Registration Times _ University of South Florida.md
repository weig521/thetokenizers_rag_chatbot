## Registration Times

Registration times are assigned to students based on current classification (Graduate
Students, Fourth-Year Students, Third-Year Students, Second-Year Students, First-Year
Students). Priority is given to graduate and then undergraduate students. Once a student's
registration time has passed, students can continue to access the registration system
through the end of the add/drop period in the first week of the term.

To be fair to all students, the Registrar’s Office cannot update registration appointment
times unless there is an error.

**Please follow this path to view your registration appointment time:** Log in to [MyUSF](http://my.usf.edu/), access your **Student Self-Service** and go to **Student** → **Registration** → **Registration Status** → **Select Term**.
