### Special Program/Degree Information

#### Applying for Two Degrees:

Undergraduate students who signed a contract to complete two degrees and all international
students approved to pursue two graduate degrees cannot apply for one degree without
the other. Even if the requirements for one have been met, both degrees must be requested
in the same term. A separate application is required for each degree. If you are pursuing
two majors, you may also have to submit two graduation applications.

#### Honors GPA and Student Self-Service

Your honors GPA may be different than the GPA you see in Student Self-Service and
Degree Works as there are specific requirements which must be met to qualify for i[nstitutional honors at graduation](https://catalog.usf.edu/content.php?catoid=23&navoid=3956&hl=%22honor%22&returnto=search#honors-at-graduation). Consult with your college advising team for additional questions related to graduating
with honors.
