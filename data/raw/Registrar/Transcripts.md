## Transcripts

**Degree Certified Transcripts**

Transcripts with degree statements are available **approximately six weeks after grades are visible on [Student Self-Service](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/register/studentself-service.aspx)** (formerly OASIS), regardless of whether you participate in Commencement. You may request
a final official transcript with the degree statement once you have received an email
confirmation that your degree has been awarded. Please ensure you review your Student
Self-Service account to confirm there are no holds that may prevent the release of
your credentials. For more information on ordering transcripts, please visit our [Transcript page](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/services/transcripts/index.aspx).
