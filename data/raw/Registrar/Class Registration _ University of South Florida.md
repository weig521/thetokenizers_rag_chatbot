### Preparing for Registration

Registering for your classes is easiest when you're well prepared. You can prepare
for registration by meeting with your academic advisor, using the Plan Ahead tool
in Student Self-Service, and viewing your registration time.

#### ✅ Meet With Your Advisor

We recommend that you meet with an academic advisor prior to registration. Meeting
with an academic advisor ensures that you are taking the appropriate classes for your
degree each term, and will keep you on the most efficient path towards graduation.
[Contact your College to schedule an advising appointment.](https://www.usf.edu/undergrad/students/advising-offices.aspx)

#### ✅ Use the Plan Ahead Tool

"Plan Ahead" is a tool that allows you to build your desired class schedule in advance
of the actual registration cycle. For example, you can plan to register for a lecture
and a lab by adding both the lecture and the lab to your planned schedule. Then, you
can add both to your registration summary at the same time when your registration
window opens, simplifying the process.

Access the Plan Ahead tool by navigating to **Student** → **Registration** → **Plan & Register** → **Plan** **Ahead**.

#### ✅ View Your Registration Times

At USF, students register for classes during different windows, which are determined
by a variety of factors, including grade level or veteran status. After you've met
with your advisor and planned your ideal courses, you can prepare to register by marking
your registration time on your calendar. Here's how to view your window:

* Log in to [MyUSF.](http://my.usf.edu/)
* Access your **Student Self-Service** account and then navigate to **Student** → **Registration** → **Registration Status** → **Select Term.**

**Note:** You can view your window up to *three weeks before* registration begins for a given term.

#### Additional Registra**tion Questions**

[Show Why am I in a later registration time than I think I should be based on my credits?](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/register/index.aspx)

Registration appointment times reflect the overall credit hours that you have earned.
Your registration time does not take into account the in-progress credits that you
are taking in the current term.

[Show I am a graduating senior. Why am I not registering first?](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/register/index.aspx)

The university has designated special populations who are granted priority registration,
including US military veterans, active duty service members and their dependents,
and students in the ROTC program; students with an accommodation on file; honors students,
and student athletes. If you fall within one of these populations and do not have
an early registration time, please contact registrarupdates@usf.edu.

[Show Where can I go to see the class schedule search?](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/register/index.aspx)

Students can click on Plan & Register in Student Self Service. They can also get to
the class schedule search from **Student Profile** →  **Plan & Register** and from the navigation on the left side of this page.

**Please note:** Clicking on Search for Classes does not provide the ability to register. You must
select Plan & Register to add sections.

[Show How do I know what the prerequisites are for a class?](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/register/index.aspx)

The title of each class is hyperlinked. Click on the hyperlink and a pop-up window
will appear. Then click on **Prerequisites**. You will then be able to see if a class has any necessary prerequisites.

[Show Where do I see the start and end dates of a class?](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/register/index.aspx)

You can see start and end dates in several locations. When searching for a section,
you can hover over the meeting times and additional class information will be brought
up in a pop-up window.

### How to Register in Student Self-Service

Ready to register? If it's your first time registering for classes in Student Self-Service,
you've encountered a problem, or you're looking for a refresher, we have resources
for you.

When your registration window arrives, use [our video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YClXuasM4) to follow along as you navigate Student Self-Service.

If you experience technical difficulties, check out our FAQs below or [reach out to IT for help](https://www.usf.edu/it/get-help).

#### Technical FAQs

[Show Why do I see a message that tells me to use Ctrl + Alt+ C?](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/register/index.aspx)

If you are seeing this message, it is a shortcut key that helps reset your view as
the images may have become skewed when switching between monitors or screens. If you
press Ctrl+Alt+C together, the panels will appear again as they were defaulted originally
on the screen.

![A screenshot of student self-service showing the prompt the press Ctrl+Alt+C](./Class Registration _ University of South Florida_files/window-message-ctrl-alt-c.png)

[Show I am unable to click on any links within the Student Self Service pages. What is wrong?](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/register/index.aspx)

Clearing cache and cookies on your computer, tablet or phone browser usually resolves
this issue. If you continue to experience issues, you can contact help@usf.edu.

[Show I'm unable to register for my lecture and lab at the same time. What should I do?](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/register/index.aspx)

We recommend adding both the lecture and the lab to your registration summary before
you click the submit button. This often resolves issues with registering for classes
that have a lecture and a lab or classes that have a concurrency.

[Show What if I get an error while registering for a lecture and still need to add a lab?](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/register/index.aspx)

You can select the conditional add/drop box at the bottom of the summary window, search
for the lab you need to add that goes with the lecture, add that to your summary window
and then make sure both sections say "Web-Register" before choosing submit. This will
allow you to register for both the lecture and the lab concurrently.

### After Registration

After you register for classes, we know you may have further questions, whether you
plan to proceed with your schedule as-is or you want to update your schedule by adding
or dropping a class.

#### How to View Your Schedule in Student Self-Service

In your Student Self-Service account, navigate to **Student** → **Registration** → **Registration Status** → **Select Term**. Click on the tab titled "Schedule and Options." This is your schedule view, where
you can see your class schedule and use it to plan your term.

Please note: Only In-person classes will show on the schedule view. To see your online
class listings, click on **Schedule Details** or Schedule and Options from the Register for Classes link.![A screenshot of the online course schedule view in Student Self-Service.](./Class Registration _ University of South Florida_files/online-course-schedule-view.png)

#### How to Withdraw from A Class

To withdraw, go to **Register for Class** from the **Plan and Register** tab on Student Self Service. Select the term and then go to the **Summary window** in the bottom right of the screen. You will see an action box. Choose the dropdown
and select the action you would like to take.

Once you have chosen the action, choose **Submit** at the bottom of the page. Status for the class will then change from **Registered** to **Dropped**.
