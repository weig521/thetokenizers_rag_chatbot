## Independent vs. Dependent

### DEPENDENT STUDENT

A dependent student is under the age of 24 and a legal resident of the same state
as their parent/legal guardian. To qualify for in-state status, the student's parent/legal
guardian must complete the [Request for Reclassification](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/documents/forms/uro-resyreclass.pdf) on behalf of the student.

The parent/legal guardian is responsible for providing legal ties to the state of
Florida and demonstrating an absence of legal ties with any other state.

### Independent student

A student is considered independent if they meet any of the following requirements:

* 24 years of age prior to the start of the term **OR**
* A graduate student **OR**
* Under the age of 24 and married **OR**
* Under the age of 24 and has a dependent that receives more than half their support
  from the student **OR**
* A legally emancipated person **OR**
* Unaccompanied homeless youth determined by a school district or homeless liaison **OR**
* Under the age of 24 **AND** provides a minimum of 51% of their own support.

If the student is under 24 years old, the student must document the source of the
financial support and clearly demonstrate that the parent/legal guardian is no longer
eligible to claim the student as a dependent for federal income tax purposes.
