## Appeal Procedure

A student may appeal the residency decision to the University Residency Appeals Committee.
The appeal process includes an opportunity to submit a written appeal for review.
The individual is notified of the Committee's decision in writing, and, if denied,
will include the reason the appeal was denied. The Residency Appeals Committee makes
a recommendation to the University Registrar, whose decision is final.

If you have questions or concerns about your particular circumstances, please email
the Office of the Registrar.
