## Proof of Enrollment

Current students should request proof of enrollment from USF or a Good Student Discount
certificate for their insurance company by logging into [MyUSF](https://my.usf.edu/) with their **NetID** and password and selecting **Proof of Enrollment** under the Student Records menu of [Student Self-Service](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/register/studentself-service.aspx) (formerly OASIS). This will take students to the National Student Clearinghouse.

The National Student Clearinghouse (NSC) is USF's authorized agent for providing proof
of enrollment. This is the only way that USF provides basic Proof of Enrollment; students
should use this service to view and print their enrollment certification.

**Please note:** Proof of enrollment is available for the current term starting the **second** week of classes. Future enrollment cannot be certified. Please refer to the [Important Dates and Deadlines](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/calendars/) for the applicable dates.

**Non degree-seeking student and undergraduates enrollment status requirements are the
same.**

### **Enrollment Status Descriptions**

The following illustrates the hours of enrollment necessary to be classified as full,
half, and less than half-time status:

**Undergraduate**

* Full-time: 12 or more credit hours
* Half-time: 6-11 credit hours
* Less than half-time: 1-5 credit hours

**Graduate**

* Full-time: 9 or more credit hours

Students with unique required forms for enrollment or degree certification should
send these forms electronically to enrollmentcerts@usf.edu. **Please note:** If the form is a basic enrollment certification, students will be instructed to follow
the above steps. Otherwise, students will receive a confirmation email that will state
the expected processing time, which varies during each academic term.

[Show Loan Deferment Requests](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/services/enrollment.aspx)

**Please note:** Deferment requests are available for the current term starting the **second** week of classes.. Please refer to the [Important Dates and Deadlines](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/calendars/) for the applicable dates.

USF utilizes an electronic loan deferment process. The NSC collects enrollment data
 from  USF and disperses it to lending agencies to allow students to defer loans.

If your lender needs a deferment form processed, please email your completed and signed
form to enrollmentcerts@usf.edu. **Note:** incomplete and unsigned forms will not be processed.

All loan deferment request forms are sent to the NSC for processing. Once the NSC
receives the request, lenders are notified of enrollment and the deferment is put
into effect as of the start of the semester. If you have any questions about the deferment
process, please contact your lender.

The NSC asks that if a student receives a collection letter from a servicer, the student
does the following:

1. Call the lending agency to see if a deferment form was received between the time the
   NSC supplied the information and the lending agency sent the collection letter.
2. If, after calling the servicer, it still appears that the deferment has not been processed,
   the student may call the NSC at (703) 742-7791 and ask to speak to a Student Service
   Representative. The representative will verify the date on which the deferment form
   was received by the NSC, the date the deferment was certified and mailed, the enrollment
   status that was certified, and where the forms were sent.
3. If an emergency exists - for example, you are 150 days delinquent and being threatened
   with default - the NSC will intervene on your behalf by sending another enrollment
   certification to the servicer. Further, the NSC will work with the servicer to ensure
   that the form is processed on a high-priority basis.
