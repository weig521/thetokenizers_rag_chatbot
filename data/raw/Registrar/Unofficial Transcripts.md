## Unofficial Transcripts

Students who have completed at least one term at USF have access to unofficial transcripts
through [Florida Shines](https://www.floridashines.org/check-your-progress).

**Accessing your unofficial transcript**

* Navigate to [Florida Shines](https://www.floridashines.org/check-your-progress)
* Select "Check Now" under the transcript section
* Choose "University of South Florida" from the drop-down menu
* Sign-in with your USF NetID and password

**Important Information**

* Unofficial transcripts are **only** available to current students and students who still have access to myUSF. If you
  are unable to log in to your [Student Self-Service](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/register/studentself-service.aspx) (formerly OASIS) account or [Florida Shines](https://www.floridashines.org/check-your-progress) account directly, you must request an official transcript through the [National Student Clearinghouse](https://tsorder.studentclearinghouse.org/school/ficecode/00153700).
* The Office of the Registrar cannot provide a student with a copy of their unofficial
  transcript; currently, unofficial transcripts are only available through Florida Shines.
* Unofficial transcripts cannot replace an official transcript in instances that specifically
  ask for an official transcript (admission to another institution, application for
  employment...etc).
* Unofficial transcripts are clearly marked "unofficial" and are not digitally certified.
