## Diplomas

Once awarded, your diploma will be mailed via First Class U.S. Mail approximately
six to eight weeks after final grades officially post for the final semester. This
delivery date may be delayed due to University closure or official postal service
interruptions.

If your diploma is printed incorrectly due to university error or it is damaged in
route, you may return the incorrect or damaged diploma to the Office of the Registrar
for one complimentary replacement.

[Show Diploma Information](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/services/apply-for-graduation/diplomas.aspx)

Verify or update the name to be printed on your diploma. If your name includes special
characters that cannot be captured, send an email to graduation@usf.edu illustrating how you would like your name to appear on your diploma. Pursuant to
[Policy 11-009](https://usf.app.box.com/v/usfpolicy11-009), you may enter a preferred/chosen name on the diploma instead of your legal name.
If you are a foreign national student, International Services must pre-approve a [Name Change Request](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/services/preferred-name.aspx) before you complete the graduation application. If you need an Apostille or Notarized
Diploma, your full legal name must be used. Students may also enter the address they
wish the diploma to be mailed.

statement to be affixed. After we receive your diploma back from our vendor, the notarized
request will be processed within 5-7 business days and placed at the front counter
for pick up or mailed to you. Please note that we cannot send the diploma directly
to the State because there is a cost associated with the Apostille process.

Please note: If your diploma is damaged, we cannot process your request. You will
need to place an order for a new diploma. Only diplomas with legal names may be notarized.

2. Along with your original diploma, you must provide a signed letter affirming your
desire to have your diploma notarized. Your letter must include your USF ID number,
where the diploma should be mailed or include contact information for pick up, and
your signature. Please note that we cannot send the diploma directly to the State
because there is a cost associated with the Apostille process.

counter for pick up or mailed to you.

*The official Apostille is not completed by the Office of the Registrar.*

In today's Global Economy, many students choose to expand their life experience by
taking jobs in their field of study outside of the United States after they graduate.
Using the skills and knowledge they have acquired at USF, many of our students help
others around the world. In most cases, before being approved to work overseas, a
student will need to have their documents verified by a government agency in the United
States by having an Apostille attached to the diploma or transcripts.

To have your diploma Apostilled, you will need to have your documents verified by
a government agency in the United States. Students that wish to have an Apostille
attached to a diploma must first have their original diploma notarized by the Office
of the Registrar.
