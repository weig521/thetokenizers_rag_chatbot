### 25Live FAQ - General

[Show What is 25Live?](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/faculty-staff/request-space/index.aspx)

25Live is the USF system wide scheduling software for events and classes. It is used
by all campuses to schedule rooms for events and is used by the Registrar's Office
Space & Scheduling team to schedule classes. Anyone with a NetID and password can
view what is scheduled in the system. At this time, general use classroom space on
all campuses is managed within 25Live but not all department spaces have been added.
In the future, our goal is to get all spaces incorporated into 25Live.

[Show Who can request space?](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/faculty-staff/request-space/index.aspx)

Academic and administrative departments across the USF system are allowed to request
space in 25Live. If you do not already have REQUESTOR access, please watch the NEW
25LIVE TRAINING video then complete the 25Live Access Request Form. Please allow 5-7
days for your access request to be processed. You will be notified once access is
granted.

Students are not allowed to request or use academic space on the Tampa or St. Petersburg
campuses. Students who need space are referred to the Marshall Student Center or the
University Student Center, respectively.

Note:  Need access to 25Live for **USF Health**? Contact Heather Bush instead of completing the access form.

[Show How can I view the layout of a classroom?](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/faculty-staff/request-space/index.aspx)

On the main 25Live dashboard, enter the bldg and room number (ex. CPR 103) in the
Locations box and search. Select the room number in the search results. Details of
the classroom including the layout, features, and the capacity will be displayed.

[Show What are the general use classrooms vs dedicated departmental classrooms?](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/faculty-staff/request-space/index.aspx)

General Use classrooms exist on all three campuses among multiple buildings. These
classrooms are managed by the Space & Scheduling team. The active list of General
Use Classrooms can be found [here](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/faculty-staff/general-use-classrooms/). These classrooms have priority for academic courses. When all courses are placed
after the first week of classes, these rooms are available for events such as orientations,
reviews, make up exams, lectures and other academic related events.

Dedicated departmental classrooms are managed by colleges and departments. These rooms
must give priority to out-of-pattern courses and must optimize classroom time and
capacity utilization.

[Show How do I know if a room is unlocked?](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/faculty-staff/request-space/index.aspx)

Once the event is scheduled, the appropriate areas involved will be notified to ensure
the space is unlocked and available. All classroom doors are unlocked 30 minutes prior
to the event's start time.

### 25Live FAQ - Classes

[Show When are large capacity, special requests, and physical limitations requests due?](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/faculty-staff/request-space/index.aspx)

All of the above requests can be found on the [class scheduling timetable guideline.](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/documents/timetable.pdf) The dates are subject to change. Always consult the website for the most up-to-date
version of this timetable.

[Show Can I view the layout, features, and capacity of a classroom?](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/faculty-staff/request-space/index.aspx)

Yes! On the main 25Live dashboard, enter the bldg and room number (ex. CPR 103) in
the Locations box and search (or enter). Select the room number in the search results.
Details of the classroom including the layout, features, and the capacity will be
displayed. To zoom in on the room, click on the photo. If there isn't a photo of the
space, the room information has not been fully implemented.

[Show How can I verify where a class is scheduled?](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/faculty-staff/request-space/index.aspx)

On the main 25Live dashboard, enter the 5-digit CRN in the Event box and search (or
enter). Click the **FUTURE** button to prevent an old course from a prior term with the same CRN from appearing.
The location can be viewed in the search results. You can click on **CALENDAR** for a different view of the days/times.

[Show Can I request a room for a class using 25Live?](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/faculty-staff/request-space/index.aspx)

**No**. Requesting a room within 25Live is only for events. You may find it helpful to utilize
25Live to see what spaces are available, but the request for a room for a class must
be made by pinging us in the Academic Scheduler TEAMS channel or emailing askspace@usf.edu.

25Live and Banner "talk" to each other via software called Lynx. Due to the complexities
and nuances of this software, rooms for classes can only be scheduled in 25Live by
the Space & Scheduling team.

**WARNING:** Scheduling a course using the Event tool will only cause errors which breaks the
Lynx connection and could result in dangerous doublebookings.

[Show Can I change my classroom in 25Live?](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/faculty-staff/request-space/index.aspx)

No. You may view available spaces using 25Live, but if you need to request a different
room you will need to use the Academic Scheduler TEAMS channel or email askspace@usf.edu. Please remember that rooms for classes may only be changed if there is a need for
a faculty accommodation or the current room does not match the pedagogy of the course.

[Show What about alternative calendar classes that don't meet regularly all semester? Are
these listed in 25Live and how should Banner look?](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/faculty-staff/request-space/index.aspx)

Alternative calendar courses do not follow typical meeting patterns and do not meet
the entire term. When 25Live receives the information from Banner via the Lynx software,
the system assumes the course is meeting the entire term. Therefore, to avoid conflicts
and inaccurate schedules of rooms, any alternative calendar courses with a non-standard
meeting pattern are entered in 25Live as **events** by the Space & Scheduling team.

The building and room assignment in Banner should be listed as TBA% TBA (% is T, S,
P depending on campus). The actual room assignment should be added to the comments
of the section on SSATEXT in Banner.
