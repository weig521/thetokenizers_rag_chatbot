## Residency Information

Being a Florida resident for tuition purposes means the student pays less per credit
hour than a non-Florida resident. In order to be classified as a Florida resident
for tuition purposes, the student or the student's parent/legal guardian must have
established [Bona Fide Domicile](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/services/residency/residency_def.aspx) and [legal ties](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/services/residency/residency_def.aspx) to the state for Florida, at least 12 consecutive months prior to the first day of
the term in which the student is seeking in-state residency status. A student is classified
as either a [dependent](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/services/residency/independent_dependent.aspx) or [independent](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/services/residency/independent_dependent.aspx) student.  In rare cases, a student may qualify for temporary in-state status by qualifying
under an [Exception Category](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/services/residency/exception_categories.aspx).

Have questions about Florida's requirements and definitions for in-state residency?
[**Florida****Statute Section 1009.21**](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=1000-1099/1009/Sections/1009.21.html "Florida Statue Section 1009.21") provides information on the criteria required by the State of Florida.
