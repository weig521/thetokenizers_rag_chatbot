## Class Permits

### WHAT IS A PERMIT?

Some classes or sections of a class have restrictions such as pre-requisites, co-requisites
or permission by academic department that are required in order to register. Our registration
system will alert you when a permit is required. In order to register for these sections,
you must contact the specific department offering the class.

* If approved, the college or department will issue the permit electronically.
* Post approval, you will be able to add the section to your registration.
* Once registered, you are responsible for all tuition and fees related to the section.

---

### DO I NEED A PERMIT?

An inability to register for a particular section does not necessarily indicate that
a permit is required. Registration in a particular class can be blocked for several
reasons. Errors can occur when the registration system does not recognize your pre-requisite,
co-requisite, or exam credit. Registration can also be restricted to certain majors
only. If you are unable to register, read the registration-add error message for more
information.

* **College of Arts and Sciences Students:** Unsure of which department to contact for a permit? Check the [College of Arts and Sciences Permit Request Guide](https://www.usf.edu/registrar/documents/permit-request-undergrads-cas-v3.pdf).
* **Is the department you're looking for not on the list?** Current degree-seeking undergraduates can also secure permits through **Archivum**. Here’s how:
  + Contact the department for the class in which you need a permit. Archivum does not
    restrict students to only scheduling appointments with their major advisors.
  + For example, if you are a marketing major who needs a permit for a communications
    class, you can do a 'drop-in appointment' in CAS for communications and tell them
    that you need a permit.
* **Is your class being offered by USF St. Petersburg Campus or USF Sarasota-Manatee Campus?
  Use the respective online submission form.**
